**Scenario**

Imagine you're developing a program for a fitness tracker app.

The app tracks various activities like running, cycling, and swimming.

Each activity has its way of calculating calories burned, but they all share some common functionalities like recording duration and distance.

**Task**

Add a Running activity and show calories burnt
Add a Swimming activity and show calories burnt
Add a Walking activity and show calories burnt
Add the ability to include BMR (Base metabolic rate - i.e. latent calories burnt regardless of activity)
Demonstrate how this influences Running or another activity
Bonus points: support multiple users or other features that make sense
